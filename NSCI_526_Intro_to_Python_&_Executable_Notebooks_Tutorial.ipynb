        "\n",
        "An executable or computational notebook (e.g. a Jupyter notebook, R Markdown) is a way to neatly write and develop code. You will see examples below, but it is possible to embed code within a \"cell\" and surround it with other cells containing text and explaining what the code does/should do. Importantly, this kind of format makes it easier to read and follow the code. Additionally, the results can be reproduced immediately following each coding cell. According to Stephen Wolfram (thanks, Wikipedia for the quote!), \"The idea of a notebook is to have an interactive document that freely mixes code, results, graphics, text, and everything else.\" What more could you want?!\n",
        "\n",
        "Computational notebooks have been used heavily for data science work. There is an initiative within the larger scientific community to publish \"[executable papers](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-020-00403-4).\"\n",

        "1.   Code cells. A **code cell** is a block that actually holds the code that we want. There are two ways to indcate that you want the cell to be a code cell. One way is by simply manually clicking the code cell block in the toolbar. Another way is by hitting (esc, y) while having a cell selected. It is necessary to hit enter afterwards to edit the cell. If you want to execute the code, hit (shift + enter). Rather than progressing down the page sequentially, the code is interpreted in the order that you execute it. I'll show an example of this later on. \n",
        "\n",
        "2.   Markdown cells. (Hint: this is a markdown cell). A **markdown cell** can also be thought about as a text cell. The text here is written in markdown which is a lightweight markup language and has its own syntax rules. It is also possible to insert HTML into markdown cells. Just like for the code cells, there are two main ways to indicate that you want the cell to be considered a markdown cell. One way is by simply manually clicking the markdown cell block in the toolbar. Another way is by hitting (esc, m) while having a cell selected. It is necessary to hit enter aftewrards to edit the cell. Just as before, hitting (shift + enter) will run the cell. \n",
